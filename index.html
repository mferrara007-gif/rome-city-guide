                        text: `The Colosseum stands not merely as a ruin but as a textbook of Roman pragmatism and political theater. Look past the bloodthirsty imagery of the gladiators and instead focus on the pockmarks riddling the travertine facade. These are the scars of the Middle Ages, when the iron clamps holding the massive stones together were quarried out by locals, leaving the building as a skeletal testament to its own structural resilience. Built upon the site of Nero's artificial lake, the Flavians intended this to be a populist gesture—returning to the people the land that a tyrant had stolen for his private 'Golden House'. Notice the subtle architectural progression: the ground floor utilizes the sturdy Doric order, the second the more elegant Ionic, and the third the ornate Corinthian, reflecting a social hierarchy in stone. The elite sat nearest the arena, shielded from the sun by a massive silk awning, the 'Velarium', operated by a specialized detachment of imperial sailors from the fleet at Misenum. It was a masterpiece of crowd control, where 50,000 spectators could be evacuated in minutes through the 'vomitoria' (exit tunnels). Today, it stands as a skeleton, stripped of its marble skin, yet its architectural bones remain the blueprint for every modern stadium on earth. It is a monument to the Roman obsession with control—control over nature, control over the masses, and control over death itself. The sheer verticality of the outer walls, reaching nearly 50 meters, was designed to overwhelm the viewer, asserting the power of the Flavian dynasty after the chaos of the civil wars. To walk through its corridors is to walk through a machine of state propaganda, where the architecture itself was a tool for pacifying the restless Roman populace through a diet of 'bread and circuses'.`

                        text: `The Arch of Constantine is a fascinating exercise in what historians call 'spoliation'—the recycling of older monuments to build something new. Erected in 315 AD to celebrate Constantine’s victory at the Milvian Bridge, it is essentially a monumental collage. If you look closely at the reliefs, you can distinguish between the fluid, classical style of the 2nd-century panels—taken from monuments to Trajan, Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius—and the flatter, more symbolic carvings produced during Constantine's own time. This was not due to a lack of funds or talent, but a deliberate political maneuver. By literally embedding the figures of the 'Good Emperors' into his own arch, Constantine was claiming their legitimacy for his new Christianized regime. It marks the precise moment when the Roman aesthetic began its transition into the medieval, focusing on divine symbolism over physical naturalism. The arch is one of the largest and most complete triumphal arches in the city, standing as a gate between the Colosseum and the entry to the Palatine Hill. Its three spans are decorated with statues of Dacian prisoners, originally from a monument to Trajan, who appear as silent witnesses to the shifting fortunes of the empire. The attic inscription credits Constantine’s victory to 'divine inspiration', a vague phrase that avoided offending either pagans or Christians in a time of religious upheaval. It serves as a triumphal gate that looks simultaneously backward toward the golden age of empire and forward toward the fractured world of the Middle Ages, where the old gods were being replaced by the single god of the cross.`

                        text: `The Palatine is the most atmospheric of Rome's seven hills, a high-ground sanctuary where the air feels heavier with the resonance of three millennia. This was the legendary birthplace of the city, where Romulus supposedly traced the first furrow with his plow in 753 BC. The very word 'palace' is derived from this hill's name—'Palatium.' As you ascend, you are walking through the skeletal remains of the Domus Flavia and the Domus Augustana, the sprawling imperial residences that once gleamed with marble and gold. Unlike the crowded valley below, the Palatine offered the emperors cool breezes and a literal detachment from the common man. Note the 'Iron Age' huts near the crest, preserved in the middle of imperial grandeur; it is a profound irony that the mud and thatch of Romulus survived in the shadow of the marble hubris of Domitian. The hill is now a garden of ruins, where the scent of wild rosemary and stone pine creates a sensory bridge to an antiquity that was both brutal and refined. From the vantage points here, you can see the Circus Maximus on one side and the Forum on the other, realizing that the emperors lived at the exact pivot point of Roman power and pleasure. The extensive substructures of the palaces reveal the immense engineering required to expand the hill’s usable surface, creating artificial plateaus for gardens and banquet halls that once hosted the most powerful individuals on the planet. To walk the Palatine today is to experience the 'romantic ruin' in its truest form—a place where the luxury of the Caesars has been reclaimed by nature, leaving only brick arches and the occasional fragment of a marble mosaic to hint at the staggering wealth of the past.`

                        text: `Perched at the highest point of the Via Sacra, the Arch of Titus serves as a monumental gate to the Roman Forum. Dedicated in 81 AD by Domitian, it commemorates the Roman victory in the Jewish War and the triumphs of his brother Titus and father Vespasian. The most haunting detail is carved into the interior of the archway: a relief showing Roman soldiers carrying away the spoils of the Temple of Jerusalem, including the iconic seven-branched menorah, the silver trumpets, and the Table of the Showbread. For centuries, members of Rome’s Jewish community famously refused to walk beneath this arch, as it stood as a symbol of their diaspora and the destruction of their holiest site. Look to the center of the vault to see Titus depicted being carried to the heavens by a massive eagle—his 'apotheosis' or transformation into a god. The arch is a masterpiece of Flavian propaganda, using stone to freeze a moment of triumph into an eternal warning. Its simple, single-span design influenced hundreds of later triumphal arches, including the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The inscription on the east side remains remarkably clear, noting that the arch was built by 'The Senate and People of Rome' for the 'Divine Titus'. This arch marks the transition from the residential Palatine to the civic heart of the Forum, acting as a triumphal frame for anyone descending into the valley. It is a building of immense weight, both physically and historically, serving as a reminder of the brutal price of challenging Rome's authority in the eastern provinces.`

                        text: `The Via Sacra was the Main Street of the ancient world, the path taken by every victorious general during a Triumph. As you walk its length, pay attention to the basalt paving stones beneath your feet; many are original, worn smooth by the passage of two thousand years of history. This road was the setting for the most intense sensory experiences of Roman life—the smell of sacrificial incense, the shouting of lawyers from the nearby basilicas, and the constant clatter of commerce. The road’s narrowness was intentional, designed to compress the crowds and heighten the theatricality of imperial processions. It was here that the destiny of the Western world was decided on a daily basis, amidst the gossip of the markets and the prayers of the temples. Every step here is a dialogue with the past, following the exact route of Caesars and senators who walked this same volcanic stone long before it was an archaeological park. The road connects the Colosseum to the Capitoline Hill, passing by the most sacred sites of the Republic. Notice how the road rises toward the Velia hill before descending into the main square of the Forum; this 'Summa Sacra Via' provided a natural podium for the Arch of Titus. The paving stones, known as 'basoli', were cut from local volcanic rock and laid with such precision that many remained in place even after the city was abandoned. Walking here, you are treading on the literal spine of the Roman state, a path that has seen the funeral of Julius Caesar and the coronation of countless emperors, making it the most historically dense strip of land in Europe.`

                        text: `This building is a visual puzzle that perfectly illustrates the 'stratigraphy' of Rome. Originally a 2nd-century temple dedicated to the Emperor Antoninus Pius and his wife Faustina, it was converted in the Middle Ages into the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda. The ten massive monolithic columns of Cipollino marble—with their beautiful green, onion-like veins—still stand, but if you look at the upper parts of the shafts, you will see deep, diagonal grooves. These were made by medieval ropes in a failed attempt to pull the columns down for building materials. The temple’s porch refused to collapse, and so the church was simply built inside the cella. Furthermore, look at the door of the church: it is suspended several meters above the current ground level. This door shows the height of the soil in the 16th century, when the Forum was buried in meters of silt and known simply as the 'Campo Vaccino' (Cow Pasture). It is a building that has survived by inhabitation, a pagan shell protecting a Christian heart, and a witness to the city's long period of neglect. The frieze above the columns is decorated with griffins and garlands, a rare surviving example of High Imperial decorative carving. The temple stands as a testament to the longevity of Roman concrete and stone, proving that even when a city is forgotten, its foundations remain. To see the church door hanging in the air is to understand that 'Ancient Rome' was not always a pristine park, but for a long time was a subterranean ghost, waiting to be unearthed by the curiosity of the Renaissance and the science of the 19th century.`

                        text: `The Curia Julia is a rare survivor, largely because it was used as a church for over a millennium, protecting its structure from the quarrying that destroyed its neighbors. This austere brick building was the nerve center of the Roman state, the place where the Senate gathered to debate laws and declare wars. The interior is strikingly simple, featuring a rare surviving 'opus sectile' (marble inlay) floor from the Diocletian era, made of porphyry and green marble. Notice the three tiers of marble steps on either side; these are where the senators' ivory 'curule' chairs were placed. The silence of this room is deafening; for centuries, it was the loudest place in the world, vibrating with the rhetoric of Cicero and the commands of emperors. The bronze doors are replicas; the originals were moved by Borromini to the Basilica of St. John Lateran, yet another example of Rome's continuous architectural recycling. Standing inside, you are in the physical space where the concept of the 'state' as we know it was forged through compromise and conflict. The building we see today was begun by Julius Caesar and finished by Augustus, representing the transition from the Republic to the Principate. Its high ceiling was designed for acoustics, ensuring that every word of the orators could be heard. It is a building of immense gravity, stripped of its marble and gold but retaining its formidable authority. It stands as a symbol of the enduring power of law and governance, even when the empire that created it has long since vanished.`

                        text: `Dominating the northern end of the Forum, this massive three-arched monument marks a shift in Roman style toward the 'Baroque'—an aesthetic of crowded detail and towering scale. Built in 203 AD, it celebrates the victories of Septimius Severus and his sons, Caracalla and Geta, over the Parthians. A dark piece of family history is hidden in the inscription at the top: after Caracalla murdered his brother Geta to secure sole power, he ordered Geta's name and image erased from every public monument in the empire—a 'damnatio memoriae.' If you look at the fourth line of the inscription, you can see where the holes for the metal letters were filled in and the text rewritten to include extra titles for Caracalla. It is a monument to family ambition and the brutal erasure required to maintain autocracy. The reliefs are dense and chaotic, showing the Roman army as a relentless machine of conquest, a far cry from the serene idealism of earlier Augustan monuments. The arch is built of travertine and brick, once entirely faced with Proconnesian marble. It stands as a gate at the foot of the Capitoline, signifying the final triumphs of the empire before the crisis of the third century began to fracture the state. The complex carvings show siege engines, prisoners in chains, and the emperor addressing his troops, acting like a cinematic scroll of war. It is a monument that prioritizes the 'message' of power over the 'beauty' of classical proportions, signaling a new era in Roman artistic expression.`

                        text: `The eight surviving Ionic columns of the Temple of Saturn are perhaps the most evocative image of Roman decay and endurance. Dedicated to the god of time and agriculture, this site was also the state treasury, the 'Aerarium,' where the gold and silver of the Republic were stored. The temple was the focus of the Saturnalia, the winter festival where social hierarchies were inverted and slaves were served by their masters. Notice the 'eclectic' nature of the surviving columns: they are made of different types of granite and have mismatched bases, indicating a hurried reconstruction after a fire in the 4th century. It stands at the very foot of the Capitoline Hill, a threshold between the chaotic commerce of the Forum and the sacred power of the Capitol. These columns have watched the Forum transform from a bustling center of world power into a pasture for cows, and finally into the most famous archaeological site on earth. The high podium upon which the columns stand was once a fortress of wealth, guarded by the priests of Saturn. The inscription on the architrave records that the 'Senate and People of Rome restored what fire had consumed', a humble admission from a late-empire state struggling to maintain its monuments. To see these columns against the Roman sky is to witness the sheer resilience of the city's spiritual foundations. It is a place of profound silence, where the god of time seems to have won a final victory over the empire that sought to conquer it.`

                        text: `We end the afternoon by looking up at the Tabularium, the massive stone substructure that once held the Roman state archives. Above it sits the Piazza del Campidoglio, Michelangelo’s Renaissance masterpiece. This hill was the spiritual citadel of ancient Rome, home to the great Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. While the Forum below represents the 'death' of the ancient city, the Capitoline represents its 'rebirth.' The walk up the Cordonata ramp is a deliberate psychological experience designed by Michelangelo to make the visitor feel as if they are ascending to a place of supreme authority. Looking back from the terrace at sunset, you see the Forum as a forest of stone shadows, a landscape where the light of the present constantly illuminates the bones of the past. It is the best place to contemplate the sheer longevity of the city—a view that has remained essentially the same in spirit for over two thousand years. The Tabularium’s massive arches of Sperone stone provided the literal foundation for the modern city hall (Palazzo Senatorio), a perfect metaphor for the way Rome uses its past as the bedrock for its present. On this hill, the medieval, the Renaissance, and the ancient are fused into a single monumental experience. The statue of Marcus Aurelius in the center of the square (a replica, the original is in the museum) survived the Middle Ages only because it was mistaken for Constantine, the first Christian emperor. This hill is the ultimate destination for the Roman pilgrim, a place where the city's identity as the 'Caput Mundi' (Head of the World) is most physically felt.`

Notice the 'Belvedere Torso' nearby (usually found just inside), which Michelangelo famously refused to 'complete' because he believed its ruined state was perfect. In the center of the courtyard sits Arnaldo Pomodoro’s 'Sphere Within Sphere,' a modern bronze that serves as a profound counterpoint to the ancient pinecone. The golden sphere is cracked open to reveal a complex, mechanical interior—a metaphor for the fragility and intricacy of our modern world compared to the singular, solid forms of antiquity. This courtyard is the threshold of the Papal collections, a place to reset your eyes before the overwhelming visual density of the galleries ahead. The massive niche designed by Bramante at the end of the court was inspired by the Pantheon, showing how the architects of the Renaissance sought to outdo the ancients in their own language. Standing here, you are in a space designed to accommodate the 'Grand Tour' of the soul, where the beauty of the natural world and the brilliance of human creation are meant to lead the mind toward the divine. It is a space of transitions—between the outdoors and the indoor galleries, and between the old gods and the new.`

                        text: `While the world rushes toward the Sistine Chapel, the Raphael Rooms—the former private apartments of Pope Julius II—offer a more intellectual and balanced view of the High Renaissance. In the 'School of Athens,' Raphael created a visual manifesto of Humanism, celebrating the power of reason. He painted the great philosophers of antiquity but gave them the faces of his contemporaries: Plato is a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, and the brooding Heraclitus in the foreground is a clear nod to Michelangelo. Notice the perfect architectural perspective, which creates an illusion of vast, vaulted space that doesn't actually exist, perfectly mirroring the ideals of the High Renaissance. This room is a dialogue between faith and reason, painted at the precise moment when the Church was attempting to synthesize classical philosophy with Christian doctrine. It represents the peak of harmony in Western art, a world where every figure and every line is placed with divine mathematical certainty. The four rooms—the Sala di Costantino, the Stanza di Eliodoro, the Stanza della Segnatura, and the Stanza dell'Incendio del Borgo—show Raphael’s development from a young prodigy to a master of complex, dynamic composition. In 'The Disputation of the Holy Sacrament' opposite the School of Athens, Raphael balances the intellectual realm of the philosophers with the spiritual realm of the saints, creating a perfect symmetry between heaven and earth. To walk through these rooms is to experience the 'Golden Age' of Rome’s second empire—the empire of art and intellect that rebuilt the city after centuries of medieval darkness.`

Look at the 'Last Judgment' on the altar wall, painted 25 years after the ceiling frescoes. The difference is stark: the ceiling represents the hope and beauty of creation, while the altar wall reflects the turmoil of the Sack of Rome and the Reformation. Michelangelo's figures here are more muscular, more tormented, and the blue of the sky is an expensive, deep lapis lazuli. Look for Michelangelo’s 'hidden' self-portrait in the flayed skin of St. Bartholomew—a testament to his own spiritual exhaustion and his feeling of being 'stripped' by the demands of his papal patrons. The ceiling itself, painted between 1508 and 1512, remains one of the greatest feats of physical endurance in art history; Michelangelo worked on scaffolding for four years, suffering permanent damage to his eyesight and neck. The central nine scenes from Genesis show the struggle of the human soul to reach the divine, culminating in the iconic 'Creation of Adam'. Notice the 'Ignudi' (naked youths) that surround the scenes; they represent the pure joy of the human form that Michelangelo championed above all else. The chapel serves as the private sanctuary of the Popes and the site of the Conclave, but for the visitor, it is the most intimate encounter possible with the mind of a genius who felt the weight of God in every stroke of the brush. It is a space where the ceiling literally seems to ripple with the energy of the divine, changing the course of Western art forever.`

The scale is designed to be incomprehensible; the cherubs holding the holy water fonts are actually six feet tall, and the letters of the inscription around the dome are as high as a man. Notice the play of light: Bernini's 'Cathedra Petri' (Throne of St. Peter) at the far end features an alabaster window where the Holy Spirit as a dove is surrounded by golden rays. When the sun hits it, the light pours into the nave like liquid gold. Look at the Baldacchino, the massive bronze canopy over the high altar; its bronze was stripped from the Pantheon by the Barberini Pope, leading to the famous Roman quip about the family being worse than the barbarians. The Basilica is a building meant to prove that the Papacy is the true heir to the Roman Empire, using the same colossal scale and materials to create a palace for the soul. The dome, designed by Michelangelo and finished by Giacomo della Porta, remains the spiritual crown of the city, visible from every hill in Rome. Inside, you will find Michelangelo’s 'Pietà', a work of such profound tenderness that it seems impossible it was carved from stone. It is the only work Michelangelo ever signed, a testament to its perfection. The floor of the nave contains markers showing the lengths of other great churches, all of which fall short of St. Peter's grand proportions. This is not just a church; it is a manifestation of the Church Triumphant, a building that seeks to unite the majesty of the heavens with the architectural legacy of the Caesars.`

There are 284 columns, and if you stand on the marble disk marked 'Centro del Colonnato,' the four rows of columns perfectly align so that they appear to be only one. This is Baroque theater at its most deceptive. The Egyptian obelisk in the center was brought to Rome by Caligula and stood in the circus where Peter was executed—it is a 'silent witness' to the very foundation of the faith. The square is a masterpiece of urban planning, turning a chaotic medieval slum into a grand stage that can accommodate 300,000 people. It is the transition point between the sovereign enclave of the Vatican and the secular world of the city, designed to make every pilgrim feel as if they are entering the very heart of the world. Notice how the two 'arms' of the colonnade do not meet the church directly, but are joined by two straight corridors, creating a trapezoidal space that makes the facade of the church appear taller and more narrow than it actually is. The 140 statues of saints on top of the colonnade stand like a celestial crowd, cheering on the pilgrims below. The fountains on either side, by Maderno and Bernini, provide a constant sound of flowing water, masking the noise of the city and creating a sanctuary of order and symmetry. It is the grandest foyer in the world, a space where the logic of geometry is used to inspire a sense of divine harmony.`

To build it, a dense medieval neighborhood known as the 'Spina di Borgo' was demolished. While it provides a grand, cinematic approach, it lacks the organic texture of the rest of Rome and destroyed the 'surprise' that pilgrims used to feel when they emerged from dark, cramped alleys into the sudden, overwhelming vastness of St. Peter's Square. Notice the lanterns along the road; they are styled to look like ancient Roman obelisks, a nod to the Fascist era's obsession with imperial symbolism. It is a reminder that in Rome, every generation tries to rewrite the city's topography to suit its own political narrative. The demolition of the Spina was a loss of historical layering; where once there were taverns and pilgrim hostels, there is now a parade ground. However, the avenue does offer the most iconic long-distance view of the dome, framing it perfectly between the new palazzi. To walk here is to experience the 'Modernist Rome' that sought to rationalize the city's chaos into broad vistas and straight lines. It stands as a bridge between the fortress of Castel Sant'Angelo and the sacred enclave of the Vatican, a road of political theater that remains one of the few places in Rome where the scale of the street matches the scale of the monuments.`

Originally built in the 2nd century as a tomb for Emperor Hadrian, it was later fortified into a Papal bastion, a prison, and a luxury residence. Notice the 'Passetto di Borgo,' the elevated escape tunnel connecting the Vatican to the castle. During the Sack of Rome in 1527, Pope Clement VII famously ran through this tunnel while the Swiss Guard fought to the death to protect him. At the top stands the bronze angel, commemorating the vision of St. Gregory the Great, who saw an angel sheathing a sword to signal the end of a plague. The castle is a hybrid—half imperial tomb, half medieval fortress—offering one of the most cinematic views of the city's rooftops. You can still walk up the original spiral ramp inside, built by Hadrian, which leads from the base to the heart of the tomb where the emperor's ashes were once kept. The papal apartments at the top, decorated with High Renaissance frescoes, are a world away from the grim dungeons below where Giordano Bruno was imprisoned. It is a building that has survived by constantly changing its identity, a stone witness to the city's transformation from imperial capital to papal sanctuary. The massive walls, once faced with marble and topped with a garden of cypresses, now reveal the sturdy Roman brick and concrete that have survived nearly 2,000 years of siege and transformation. It remains the anchor of the Tiber's right bank, a fortress of history in the middle of a modern city.`

Ten angels line the bridge, each holding an instrument of Christ's Passion—the cross, the crown of thorns, the nails. The angels look as if they are dancing in the wind, their marble drapery fluttering with an impossible lightness. Crossing this bridge is a ritualistic transition from the fortress-like Vatican side to the elegant, winding streets of the city center. It is a space where stone becomes fluid, and the heavy theology of the Counter-Reformation is translated into the joyous, wind-swept language of the Baroque. Notice that the angels were carved by Bernini's pupils, but two were so beautiful (the ones carved by Bernini himself) that the Pope kept them for his private collection and had copies placed on the bridge instead. The bridge serves as a monumental threshold, focusing the visitor’s eye on the angel atop the castle. The Tiber below, often turbulent, reflects the bridge's arches, which are original Roman masonry at their core. It is the most beautiful bridge in Rome, a space where the ancient engineering of the empire is dressed in the theatrical elegance of the Papacy.

The street is a sanctuary of quiet elegance, paved with the iconic black basalt 'sanpietrini' stones.

The surrounding buildings are built directly onto the foundations of the ancient spectator stands. The centerpiece is Bernini's 'Fountain of the Four Rivers.' Notice the Rio de la Plata raising its hand, allegedly in fear that the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone (designed by Bernini's rival Borromini) might collapse—a legendary symbol of the rivalry that fueled the Baroque era. At night, the square becomes a golden stage, reflecting the spirit of a city that has always viewed life as a grand, public performance. The three fountains—the Moor, the Neptune, and the Four Rivers—turn the square into an open-air museum of flowing water and stone. The obelisk in the center was moved here from the Circus of Maxentius, further reinforcing the connection between the Papal city and its Imperial predecessor. Until the 19th century, the square was flooded in August to create a 'lake' for the entertainment of the aristocracy. Today, it remains the city's living room, a place of street performers, artists, and families.

Today, it is a canyon of luxury—Prada, Gucci, Bulgari. But the heart of the street remains the Antico Caffè Greco, founded in 1760. This was the meeting place for Casanova, Goethe, Wagner, and Stendhal. To drink an espresso here is to touch the 18th-century soul of the city. The street is a paradox: a place of hyper-modern fashion built on the literal foundations of ancient engineering, where the ghosts of the Grand Tour still haunt the designer boutiques. It is the intersection of Rome's ancient practicalities and its modern obsession with appearance.`

It marks the terminus of the 'Aqua Virgo,' an ancient aqueduct built in 19 BC that still brings water into the city. The design shows Neptune (Oceanus) emerging from a rocky landscape on a chariot drawn by sea-horses. The fountain is built against the back of the Palazzo Poli, turning a private building into a public monument. The roar of the water is so loud it drowns out the noise of the city, creating a 'micro-climate' of cool mist. The tradition of tossing a coin ensures a return to Rome, but the fountain itself ensures that the city never forgets its primary life-source. Neptune emerging from a rocky landscape represents the city's mastery over its primary life-source: the water that made it the capital of the world.`

                        text: `We conclude our odyssey at the Pantheon, the architectural summit of the ancient world. This is the only major Roman building to remain in continuous use for nearly 2,000 years, largely because it was converted into a church in 609 AD. The structure you see was Hadrian’s masterpiece, a deliberate 'Temple to All Gods.' The dome remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome; its secret lies in the 'recipe' of the concrete, which gets lighter as it ascends toward the oculus. The 9-meter hole in the ceiling is the building's only light source—the 'Eye of Rome.' When it rains, the water falls onto the center of the floor and vanishes into ancient drains that still function. Inside, we find the resting place of the 'Divine' Raphael. The Renaissance master was so enamored by the Pantheon's perfection that he requested to be buried here. His epitaph, by Cardinal Bembo, captures the spirit of the city: 'Here lies Raphael; while he lived, Nature feared to be outdone by him, and when he died, she feared she herself would die.' It is a poignant intersection of pagan geometry and Renaissance soul, a building that proves that in Rome, the most profound engineering is always a form of poetry. It is the final exclamation point on a walk through a city where every stone is a page of a book that never ends.`
